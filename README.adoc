= Trimble BSP(s)

To get the BSP(s) you need to have repo installed and use it as:

Install the repo utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir trmb-yocto-bsp
$: cd trmb-yocto-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/oddlander/trmb_yocto -b pyro
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you (hopefully) have every metadata you need to start working...

To start a simple yocto image build:
[source,console]
$: MACHINE=<a_specific_trimble_board*> source ./setup-environment <name of build directory>
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at trmb-yocto-bsp/sources.
